The purpose of the program is to practise typing key sequences fast. For example to run through the queue order of some factories in games.
The user can set the hotkeys to practise by writing a .pra extension file.
The file is a list of strings. The first character of a string is the cardinality,
the second is a modifier key or a simple key's character.
Examples:
    1a -> 1 amount of 'a' key
    1^a -> 1 amount of control-a key
    2ss -> 2 amount of shift-s key
    1^s1 -> 1 amount of control-shift-1 key
    2put -> 2 clicks

The Load file button loads the .pra file (for example terran.pra for my terran queue). If the endlessly checkbox checked than we can practise the sequence more times. To quit in an endless practise press escape.
